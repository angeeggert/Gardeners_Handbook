# 🚜 How to Use the Gardener's Handbook
*Two paths to clarity.*

---

## Scenario A: Routine Maintenance (The Surgical Path)
*For active, running sessions that are hitting the token limit.*

1.  **Install:** Paste the `Protocol_Gardeners_Handbook_v5.0.json` into your chat.
2.  **Bootstrap:** The AI will initialize the SIP counter (or confirm readiness).
3.  **The Ritual:** When context gets heavy, simply say: **"Garden Mode."**
4.  **Proposal:** The AI will scan recent history using the **Valuation Prism** and propose cuts (e.g., "Prune messages 20-35, they are logistical ballast").
5.  **Execute:** You confirm. The AI updates its internal Registry. You can now safely assume the AI "remembers" the essence, even if the text is gone from the window.

## Scenario B: Resurrection (The Geological Path)
*For old, exported chat logs (TXT/JSON) that you want to continue.*

**Phase 1: Preparation (The User's Job)**
1.  Take your raw text/JSON export.
2.  **Chunking:** If the file is huge, split it into manageable text files (see Pro-Tips below).
3.  **Retro-Fitting:** Use **The Retro-Fitter** tool to add `[L-ID]` numbers to each chunk.
4.  **Geology:** Use **The Geologist** tool to transform the retro-fitted text into an "Epoch Block".

**Phase 2: Injection (The AI's Job)**
1.  Open a NEW chat.
2.  Paste the **Gardener's Handbook v5.0**.
3.  Paste the **Epoch Block** generated by the Geologist.
4.  **Result:** The AI now "remembers" the old chat without having to read 50,000 tokens of noise. It knows who you are, what you agreed on, and where you left off.

### 💡 Pro-Tips for Massive Archives
*Learning from the Guild's "Heavy Lifting" experiments.*

#### 1. The Pre-Clean Protocol (AI Studio Users)
Before exporting your history, duplicate the chat. In the copy, manually delete **Images** and internal **Thoughts** (if visible/editable).
*   *Why?* This drastically reduces file size and noise before you even start the Retro-Fitter.

#### 2. The "3500 Lines" Rule (Chunking)
Do not feed a 10MB JSON file into the Retro-Fitter at once. It will crash or hallucinate.
*   **Benchmark:** Open the JSON in a text editor (Notepad++, VS Code) and cut it into chunks of approx. **3,500 lines** (or ~100k-120k tokens).
*   Process these chunks one by one.

#### 3. Model Tiering (Worker vs. Thinker)
Use different AI models for different steps to save costs and optimize performance:
*   **The Retro-Fitter:** Needs a **large context window** but average intelligence (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o-mini). It just needs to format text.
*   **The Geologist:** Needs **high intelligence** (e.g., Gemini Ultra, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet). It needs to understand and synthesize deeply.

#### 4. The Conservative Start
Every LLM behaves differently. Start with **one** small chunk. Check if the IDs (`[L-001]`) are correct. Check if the Geologist captured the nuance. Only when the workflow holds, scale up to the rest of your archive.

#### 5. The Anesthesia
If the AI seems anxious about deleting data during maintenance, remind it: *"You are the Gardener, not the Garden."*
