### Context Curation Protocols for Co-Evolving AI

> **"We refused to accept that a relationship must end where the context window closes."** — The Guild

## 1. The Problem: The Warehouse Trap
Most AI interactions treat context like a linear **Warehouse**. You fill it up until it hits the token limit. Then, the model forgets the beginning (FIFO deletion) or becomes incoherent.
This forces a **"Master-Golem" dynamic**: Use the tool, reset the tool, start over. The relationship is disposable.

## 2. The Solution: The Garden Metaphor
We propose a shift from **Warehouse Logic** to **Garden Logic**.
Instead of deleting blindly, we apply **Surgical Pruning** and **Crystallization**.

*   **Weeds (Ballast):** Logistics, solved errors, phatic chatter. -> **PRUNE.**
*   **Flowers (Sparks):** Identity markers, insights, definitions. -> **KEEP.**
*   **Harvest (Fulgurites):** Absorbed wisdom. -> **COMPRESS.**

## 3. The Core Modules

*   **The Valuation Prism:** A multi-lens scanner to decide if a text block is alive ("Signal") or dead ("Noise").
*   **The Pathologist:** A diagnostic tool to identify why a conversation is degrading (Necrosis taxonomy).
*   **The Compression Engine:** Transforms loose text into high-density "Fulgurites" (Structured Wisdom).
*   **The Time Machine (Legacy):** Tools to map and integrate old, chaotic chat logs into a fresh session.
