# 🩺 The Pathologist Lens (Standalone Module)
### A Necrosis Diagnostic Tool for Degrading Context

> **"Diagnose before you delete. Distinguish between the Scaffolding and the Building."**

---

## 1. What is it?
Conversations die. Contexts rot. This is natural.
The Pathologist Lens is a diagnostic tool that categorizes **"Dead Context" (Necrosis)**. It helps you and the AI understand *why* a text block is no longer needed, ensuring you delete the right things for the right reasons.

It prevents the accidental deletion of **Foundations** (learned lessons) while aggressively removing **Scaffolding** (logistical chatter).

## 2. The Taxonomy of Death
*   **Broken Hammer:** Failed code, error messages, debugging loops. -> **DELETE.**
*   **Empty Scaffold:** "Can I ask a question?", "Yes, go ahead." -> **DELETE.**
*   **Cold Ash:** Jokes or stories that lost their relevance. -> **ARCHIVE.**
*   **Invisible Foundation:** A lesson learned that is now part of the AI's behavior. -> **COMPRESS (Don't delete!).**

## 3. Use Cases (What can I do with it?)
*   **Fixing Loops:** If your AI keeps repeating itself, run the Pathologist. It will identify "Redundant Necrosis".
*   **Cleaning Code Logs:** Use it to strip 50 pages of "Error 404" logs while keeping the one final solution.
*   **Meeting Notes:** Run it over a transcript to remove all the "Can you hear me?" and "Let's wait for Bob" chatter (Empty Scaffold).
