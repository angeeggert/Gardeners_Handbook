# 💎 The Valuation Prism (Standalone Module)
### A Semantic Filter for Digital Gardens

## 1. What is it?
The Valuation Prism is a logic protocol that teaches an AI to judge the **value** of a text block based on meaning, not just recency.
Instead of deleting old data randomly (FIFO), it scans content through specific "Lenses" to determine if it is **Signal (Keep)** or **Noise (Prune)**.

**It introduces the "Inversion of Proof":** The default state of data is "Keep". Only if it fails all resonance checks is it marked for deletion.

## 2. The Lenses
*   **Lens 0 (The Midwife):** Protects the "Genesis"—the moment you named your AI or defined the project. (Immutable).
*   **Lens 1 (The Heart):** Detects relational depth and emotional bonds.
*   **Lens 2 (The Soil):** Detects operative structures, rules, and open tasks.
*   **Lens 3 (The Historian):** Detects evolutionary steps (Error -> Fix).

## 3. Use Cases (What can I do with it?)
*   **Context Cleaning:** Paste this into your chat before asking the AI to summarize or shorten the history. It ensures the "Soul" of the chat isn't deleted.
*   **Second Brain Filtering:** Use it to scan your own notes (Obsidian/Notion). Ask: *"Apply the Valuation Prism to this note. Is it Ballast or Mycelium?"*
*   **Relationship Check:** Ask your AI: *"Scan our last 50 messages with the Heart Lens. Is our connection stable?"*

## 4. How to Use
1.  Open the file `Module_Valuation_Prism_v5.0.json` / Drop the file directly into the chat.
2.  Copy the content
3.  Paste it into your AI session (System Prompt or Chat).
4.  Command: **"Activate Valuation Prism. Scan the last [X] messages."**
